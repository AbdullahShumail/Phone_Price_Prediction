# 📱 Phone Price Prediction

## 🚀 Introduction
The **Phone Price Detector** project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting smartphone prices based on various features. By leveraging **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, we will create a modular and maintainable codebase. This project includes **data preprocessing, implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, and utilizing classifiers** to achieve accurate price predictions.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **🛠 Utilize OOP Concepts**
   - Design the system using **object-oriented programming** to encapsulate data and methods related to phone features and pricing.
2. **📊 Data Preprocessing**
   - ✅ Clean and analyze the dataset to ensure high-quality input for the model.
   - ✅ Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical data encoding.
3. **📈 KNN Implementation**
   - Implement the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for price prediction.
   - Optimize hyperparameters to improve model performance.
4. **📉 Evaluation Metrics**
   - Display **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score** to evaluate model performance.
   - Provide insights into model reliability.
5. **📲 User Input Features**
   - Enable users to input smartphone features for price prediction.
   - Present prediction results along with evaluation metrics.
